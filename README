Hi! Check Post.php and User.php for examples how this system is used.
If you want to execute the code just download it to your server and
start TestGenerator.php.

The system is built for presenting an idea for now. So do not be
confused by all echoes in the code and that things are only written
but not performed, even not possible to perform with current code.
